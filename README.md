Restaurant recommendation app built with Python for University of Toronto first year CS course CSC111.

The system is based off of a simpler version of collaborative filtering, a technique used by large corporations like Amazon to recommend different products to users.
The graph datastructure to support this algorithm is built inhouse and different measures to compute recommendations like cosine similarity are also implemented.
